  <h3> A Brief History of Wildfires</h3>

  <p> This year, California wildfires made headlines once again when they tore through Los Angeles County in January. The L.A. fires were a big deal, but they weren't the first time that California has been in the news for wildfires.</p>

  <p>Below is a graph of the acres burned by wildfires each year in California between 2013 and 2025. This graph shows how much variance there is each year in how much damage fires cause - this can be dependent on both the number of fires and the strength and size of the fires. </p>

  </script>

  <p>Since 2013, there have been thousands of wildfires in California that have burned close to 12 million acres. Some of these fires are small and easily contained, but some become huge - they burn hundreds, thousands, or even millions of acres and take weeks to be contained.</p>

  <p>Some burn even longer.</p>

  <p>The August Complex Fire burned for over four months. In mid August of 2020, a dry lightning storm caused hundreds of small ignitions in Northern California that would turn into California’s largest wildfire.  Lasting from August 18th until November 12th, the August Complex burned its way through seven counties and three national forests - Shasta-Trinity, Mendocino, and Six Rivers. In the end, it consumed over one million acres of California land.</p>

      <p>Often when wildfires break out in California, smoke blows into other parts of the state, making smoky or smoggy air ‘normal’. However, in September of 2020, the August Complex was so big that it caused the skies in the San Francisco Bay Area to turn a dark, disturbing orange. </p>

  <p>Regardless of the size, these fires are destructive. They destroy forests and towns, people’s homes and protected lands. National Parks and Forests lose a lot of land to wildfires, too. In 2013, the Rim Fire burned 260,000 acres in Yosemite National Park and Stanislaus National Forest in just 20 days. This fire burned down the Berkeley Tuolumne Family Camp, and came close to destroying Camp Mather, San Francisco’s family camp. </p>

  <p>Every year, Californians must face the fact that they may lose their homes, their summer camps, their schools, and other important or sentimental places. And, as the L.A. fires showed this year, big cities are not exempt from wildfires - while it may seem odd to consider cities susceptible to wildfires, they are not exempt from them. </p>

  <h3> What Causes Wildfires?</h3>

  <p>There are several factors that can impact wildfires - how they start, how big they get, and how hot they get changes for every fire. Rick Gering is a Battalion Chief for the San Francisco Fire Department, and is also certified in wildfire management and is a wildland strike team leader in El Dorado County in Northern California. He says weather and climate change are the biggest factors that impact wildfires.</p>

  <p>He says that having really wet winters, with lots of rain and snowfall causes lots of new grass growth, which becomes fuel for fires. However, he also says that having dry winters dries all the existing plants out, which makes it easier to burn.</p>

  <p> The map below shows the number of fires per county in California between 2013 and 2025 below. This map shows that different areas have different numbers of fires. Different counties have different weather, which impacts how many fires they have.</p>

  <iframe title="Number of Fires per California County Between 2013 and 2025" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-PH0dh" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PH0dh/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="781" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}}))}();
  </script>

  <p>When it comes to direct causes of wildfires, Gering says that lightning strikes are pretty common, especially during dry lightning storms. A lot of the time, in non-populated places like National Forests, fire departments often just let the fires burn. They monitor them, and intervene only when the fires seem like they will get out of control.</p>

  <p>Letting small fires burn is actually good for forests - it clears out the old debris and makes room for new growth. According to Gering, when forests and other wildlands collect a buildup of debris, it causes wildfires to burn hotter, which is more damaging. When wildfires burn really hot, it takes forests longer to recover.</p>

  <p>Wind has a major impact on how big fires get and how far they spread, Gering says. Wind fans fire and brings them more oxygen, making them stronger. Wind also spreads fire by carrying burning embers to nearby structures and across roadways. High winds during the L.A. fires is one of the biggest reasons that the fires continued to spread.</p>

    <h3>What Can I do to Protect Myself and my Home?</h3>

    <p>There are two big things that Gering recommends people have ready in order to protect themselves and their homes from fires.</p>

    <p>First, he says that people need to fire harden their homes - this means they need to make them as resilient as possible to fire. Part of fire hardening includes using fire resistant materials - like brick and mortar or clay tiles - but the biggest part of fire hardening is making sure you have defensible space around your home</p>

    <p>Defensible space basically acts as a buffer between structures and the surrounding area. Gering says it's important to clear trees and other debris away from your home and to ensure that your gutters are clean.</p>

    <p>This helps protect your home in two ways. One, it makes your home less susceptible to fire, and two, it makes firefighters more likely to try and save your home in the event of a wildfire. Gering says that firefighters skip houses that are non-defensible - as in they have not been properly taken care of. This is called fire triage - firefighters save the houses that are most likely to survive as a way to effectively utilise their time, resources, and man power. </p>

    <p>The second big thing people can do to protect themselves from wildfires is to have an evacuation plan. It is also important to actually leave when officials tell you to evacuate. One of the reasons that the fires in L.A. go so bad is because people didn't evacuate when they were told to - they waited until the last minute to leave, which caused a massive traffic back up. This led to people abandoning their cars and fleeing on foot when the fires got too close. This made it really hard for firefighters to reach fires to try and put them out.</p>

    <p>Fires are scary and dangerous - they are hard to control and hard to predict - which is why it is important to do everything you can to protect yourself in advance.</p>
